# K-Means clustering
 k-Means clustering is one of the most popular clustering methods in data mining and also in unsupervised machine learning. Here is a simple technique (actually a demonstration of the algorithm) for clustering data using k-Means Clustering method (with centroid-based). This code (for now) uses iterative method but doesn't use stopping or convergence criteria.
